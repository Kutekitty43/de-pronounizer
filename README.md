# de-pronounizer
A stupid program I made on a whim.

De-pronounizer is a stupid joke program I made on a whim when I saw a post of someone not understanding what pronouns are in a Reddit video.
Basically, it's a python file that takes a specified text file, and spits it back out under the specified output filename, with all the pronouns removed.
It's not perfect, *mostly* because I used regex for the filtering, but that seemed like the easiest way to do it, and it does its job decently.

As an example, here's the lyrics to Crush 40's "I Am... All Of Me" run through this program:
```
 see no, hear no evil
Black writing's on the wall
Unleashed a million faces
And one by one,  fall

Black-hearted evil
Brave-hearted hero am  am am
    am
Here go, buddy, here go, buddy
Here go, here go, buddy, here go
Go ahead and try to see through Do  if dare
One step forward, two steps back, I'm here
(One step forward, two steps back)

Do   do   do   do  
Can see of 
Walk into  mystery
Step inside and hold on for dear life
Do remember 
Capture or set free am  am of  am, am of  am) am, am of  am) am, am of  am) am, am of (here go!)
 see and feel the evil
 hands will crush 'em think have the answers
I'll laugh and watch fall

Black-hearted evil
Brave-hearted hero am  am  am
    am
Here go, buddy, here go, buddy
Here go, here go, buddy, here go
Go ahead and try to see through Do  if dare
One step forward, two steps back, I'm here
(One step forward, two steps back)

Do   do   do   do   do  Can see of 
Walk into  mystery
Step inside and hold on for dear life
Do remember 
Capture or set free am  am of  am, am of  am) am, am of  am) am, am of  am) am, am of (here go!)
 am, am   every Anyhow, anyway,  will,  day am, am   every Anyhow, anyway,  will,  day am, am, am am, am, am am

Do   do   do   do  
Can see of 
Walk into  mystery
Step inside and hold on for dear life
Do remember 
Capture or set free am  am of  am, am of  am) am, am of  am) am, am of  am) am, am of (here go! Here go!)  am) am, am of (here go!)
 am, am of
```
As yoy can see, there are *some* issues, but I don't care enough to fix them because this is a joke program.
